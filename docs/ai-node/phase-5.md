# Phase 5 — Distributed AI Runtime Fabric

## Goal
Turn Synthia into a distributed AI compute platform.

## New Capabilities

- Local AI providers
- Managed runtime controller
- Local model lifecycle management
- Multi-node workload routing

## Runtime Manager

Manages local AI runtimes such as:

- Ollama
- local image generation models
- local vision models

Functions:

- install/remove models
- start/stop runtime containers
- report runtime health
- expose capabilities to AI Node

## Outcome

Synthia becomes a distributed AI infrastructure combining:

- cloud providers
- local compute
- policy-driven orchestration
