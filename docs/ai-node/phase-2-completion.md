# Hexe AI Node — Phase 2 Completion

Status: Historical migration record
Completed on: 2026-03-20

## What Changed

- bootstrap namespace migrated from `synthia/bootstrap/core` to `hexe/bootstrap/core`
- trusted status telemetry namespace migrated from `synthia/nodes/{node_id}/status` to `hexe/nodes/{node_id}/status`
- bootstrap parser and config defaults now enforce the Hexe namespace
- namespace-dependent tests and documentation examples were updated to Hexe MQTT topics

## What Was Verified

- targeted code scan confirms active runtime code no longer uses `synthia/...` MQTT topics
- local bootstrap, onboarding, telemetry, security-boundary, node-control, and execution contract tests passed with the Hexe namespace
- the namespace verification checklist is recorded in [phase-2-namespace-verification-checklist.md](/home/dan/hexe/HexeAiNode/docs/ai-node/phase-2-namespace-verification-checklist.md)

## Live Integration Follow-Up

- a live Hexe Core target was verified from this workspace
- the node successfully subscribed to `hexe/bootstrap/core`, discovered Core, and reached the live registration path
- after aligning the live Core validator with the UUIDv4 node identity contract, Core accepted a UUID `node_id`, created the onboarding session, approved the registration, and issued a trust activation payload that preserved the UUID

## Remaining Legacy Items Outside Phase 2 Scope

- HTTP headers such as `X-Synthia-Node-Id` and `X-Synthia-Admin-Token`
- service IDs and unit names using `synthia-*`
- repository and path references that still point to `SynthiaCore`

## Readiness

The repository is locally ready for the MQTT namespace migration scope implemented here.

Phase 2 live namespace integration is now verified.
