# Task Details

## Task 902-910
Original task source: ad hoc operator request on 2026-05-18.

Summary of preserved scope:
- Add a supervised local llama.cpp runtime for the AI Node.
- Run llama.cpp in a container with NVIDIA GPU access on hosts that support it.
- Prefer Unix domain sockets over TCP for node-to-llama.cpp traffic.
- Keep TCP loopback as an explicit fallback for development or socket-incompatible deployments.
- Add a Python health wrapper that can be supervised and queried separately from the model server.
- Make the health wrapper check llama.cpp readiness, configured model availability, and useful GPU/container signals where practical.
- Integrate the runtime with the AI Node service metadata so Supervisor can observe and control it similarly to other node-local runtimes.
- Implement the existing `local` provider adapter against llama.cpp's OpenAI-compatible API.
- Provide an operator-facing way to compare local and OpenAI results and latency using the same prompt.
- Default the first local model target to `Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF` with `Q4_K_M` quantization unless implementation validation shows it does not fit or behave well on the RTX 3060 12 GB host.

Task mapping:
- Task 902: Define the llama.cpp local runtime contract
  - Document runtime boundaries, socket paths, model path conventions, transport fallback rules, and default model choice.
  - Proposed socket paths:
    - `/run/hexe/ai-node/llamacpp.sock`
    - `/run/hexe/ai-node/llamacpp-health.sock`

- Task 908: Add local provider configuration and model defaults
  - Add env/config fields for local provider transport, socket path, base URL fallback, default model, timeout, and runtime mode.
  - Ensure provider selection can enable `local` without requiring cloud credentials.

  - Document install, model download, runtime paths, GPU validation, socket mode, TCP fallback, and comparison workflow.

## Task 911-915
Original task source: ad hoc operator request on 2026-05-18.

Summary of preserved scope:
- Download a small candidate set of local LLM models for benchmarking on the RTX 3060 12 GB host.
- Keep the initial set small enough to avoid unnecessary disk and VRAM pressure.
- Measure model load success, prompt-processing speed, generation speed, first-token latency where practical, total latency, memory/VRAM pressure, and sustained GPU load.
- Use the benchmark data to choose the default local model instead of relying only on model reputation.
- Preserve benchmark results in a repo-local runtime/output file and surface them in diagnostics or documentation.

Initial candidate model set:
- Primary general model: `Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M`
- Lower-latency general fallback: `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M` if available from the official Qwen GGUF repositories; otherwise use an equivalent official small Qwen GGUF.
- Coding-focused comparator: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GGUF` with `Q4_K_M` or `Q5_K_M`, depending on fit and availability.
- Tiny smoke/load-control model: `ggml-org/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF` or another official llama.cpp-compatible 1B-class GGUF.

Task mapping:
- Task 911: Define local LLM benchmark model set
  - Document candidate model IDs, quantization targets, expected purpose, estimated disk/VRAM footprint, and selection rationale.

  - Allow skipping already-present models.
- Task 913: Add llama.cpp benchmark runner for candidate models
  - Add a script that runs repeatable prompts through llama.cpp or the llama.cpp server.
  - Capture load time, prompt tokens/second, generation tokens/second, total latency, output length, and errors.
  - Keep prompt set small but representative: classification, summarization, short chat, and coding/helpful-instruction prompt.
- Task 914: Add GPU load and stability test workflow for local LLM runtime
  - Add a bounded stress test that runs concurrent or repeated local inference requests.
  - Capture `nvidia-smi` samples for utilization, memory, temperature, power, and any throttling/error signals.
  - Fail safely if GPU temperature, memory pressure, or process errors exceed configured limits.
- Task 915: Store and surface local LLM benchmark results
  - Persist benchmark results under `data/` or `.run/` using a JSON schema-like structure.
  - Surface the latest benchmark summary through diagnostics or docs.
  - Use results to recommend the default local provider model for this host.

## Task 257
Original task source: `docs/New_tasks.txt`

Resolution:
- Canonical Core docs now explicitly cover the previously missing compatibility and startup-continuation details.
- The remaining local mismatch report can be treated as resolved historical context.

Evidence:
- `docs/Core-Documents/nodes/node-phase2-lifecycle-contract.md`
  - `operational_ready` is now documented as the canonical readiness signal
  - compatibility behavior for `lifecycle_state=trusted` with `operational_ready=true` is explicitly documented
- `docs/Core-Documents/nodes/node-capability-activation-architecture.md`
  - trusted startup fast-path continuation is now explicitly documented
  - node-local setup payload boundary is explicitly documented

## Task 265
Original task source: `docs/New_tasks.txt`

Resolution:
- Canonical Core docs now define the implemented provider-intelligence metrics contract for routing inputs.
- The contract confirms that the current standards path is `pricing` and `latency_metrics` maps on `available_models[]`, which matches the node's current Core-facing payload.

Evidence:
- `docs/Core-Documents/core/api/node-provider-intelligence-contract.md`
  - defines the canonical contract for `POST /api/system/nodes/providers/capabilities/report`
  - defines the admin inspection contract for `GET /api/system/nodes/providers/routing-metadata`
  - documents that Core currently persists `pricing` and `latency_metrics`
  - documents that `success_rate`, request/failure counts, usage totals, and cost totals are not yet separate normative routing fields
- `src/ai_node/core_api/capability_client.py`
  - sends `pricing` and `latency_metrics` in the compatibility payload Core consumes
- `tests/test_capability_client.py`
  - verifies provider-intelligence payload construction and latency metric propagation

## Task 324-349
Original task source: `docs/New_tasks.txt`

Normalization note:
- Original task wording used `per-user` budget grants.
- Core now defines the canonical budget contract in `docs/Core-Documents/nodes/node-budget-management-contract.md` using budget policy plus grant scopes of `node`, `customer`, and `provider`.
- This task range is aligned to that Core-owned contract so node work follows the issued policy/grant model instead of inventing a separate per-user-only contract.

Summary of preserved scope:
- Implement node-local execution-time budget enforcement against cached Core-issued budget policy and grants.
- Persist grants, usage, reservations, reset windows, and outage-tolerant refresh state locally.
- Require the execution request to carry the caller/customer identity and related fields needed to select the applicable grant.
- Enforce grant ceilings before dispatch, finalize actual spend after execution, and release reservations on rejected, failed, timed-out, or cancelled work.
- Expose diagnostics, admin/debug views, telemetry, and end-to-end tests for local budget enforcement without putting Core on the hot path.
- Update Phase 3 documentation and node-control API docs to reflect the Core-owned budget-policy contract boundary.

Task mapping:
- Task 324: Define the local budget-enforcement contract for Core-issued budget policy and cached grants
- Task 325: Verify the canonical Core budget-policy and grant schema
- Task 326: Persist budget-policy snapshots and cached grants locally
- Task 327: Persist grant usage, reservation totals, and reset-window metadata locally
- Task 328: Define the local budget period model for daily, weekly, and monthly reset windows
- Task 329: Add budget-policy refresh and cache-loading flow
- Task 330: Define canonical request fields for caller/customer identity, service identity, provider targeting, and cost constraints
- Task 331: Extend task execution request validation for customer-scoped budget enforcement
- Task 332: Define the local money-budget reservation model
- Task 333: Add pre-execution reservation checks against applicable node/customer/provider grants
- Task 334: Add post-execution budget finalization flow
- Task 335: Add reservation release behavior for rejected, failed-before-dispatch, timed-out, and cancelled executions
- Task 336: Add degraded-mode budget behavior when estimated cost exists but final cost is unavailable
- Task 337: Reject execution when no applicable active cached grant exists or the active period budget is exhausted
- Task 338: Add denial and failure taxonomy for budget enforcement outcomes
- Task 339: Add concurrency-safe reservation handling
- Task 340: Extend provider selection and execution planning to honor request-side max-cost constraints together with cached customer/provider ceilings
- Task 341: Expose budget-policy state and grant balances through diagnostics and observability
- Task 342: Add telemetry for budget-policy refresh, reservation, denial, finalization, and reset events
- Task 343: Add local admin/debug APIs for cached grants, usage, reservations, and denials
- Task 344: Add automated budget reset / rollover handling
- Task 345: Add tests for reservation math and settlement behavior

## Task 416
Original task source: `docs/New_tasks.txt`

Status:
- Completed on 2026-03-20 through live Core verification plus coordinated Core validator fix.

What was verified live:
- runtime MQTT namespace migrated from `synthia/...` to `hexe/...` for the implemented bootstrap and trusted-status paths
- tests and documentation were updated to match the migrated namespace
- local verification completed through targeted unit/integration test coverage
- live verification confirmed that the node subscribes to `hexe/bootstrap/core`, discovers Core, and attempts registration against `/api/system/nodes/onboarding/sessions`
- live verification also confirmed that on startup the node now honors Core trust-status removal and resets itself from the stale trusted state back to `unconfigured`
- after updating the live Core validator, direct Core onboarding accepted UUIDv4 `node_id` values, created an approved registration, and returned a trust activation payload with the same UUID `node_id`
- Task 346: Add tests for concurrency and double-spend prevention
- Task 347: Add tests for missing, stale, exhausted, or inconsistent grants
- Task 348: Add end-to-end local budget-enforcement tests without Core on the hot path
- Task 349: Update Phase 3 and node-control API documentation for the Core-issued budget-policy model
- nodes can execute tasks end-to-end
- scheduler-driven execution works
- provider routing is functional
- governance is enforced during execution
- telemetry reflects execution behavior
- baseline task families are operational

Observed live integration result on 2026-03-20:
- Core API health responded at `http://127.0.0.1:9001/api/health`
- Node control API responded at `http://127.0.0.1:9002/api/node/status`
- node startup queried Core trust status for the stale node identity and Core returned `support_state=removed`
- after restarting setup, the node connected to MQTT host `10.0.0.100:1884`, subscribed to `hexe/bootstrap/core`, discovered Core, and transitioned through `bootstrap_connected -> core_discovered -> registration_pending`
- the original blocker was a Core-side `node_id_invalid` rejection for UUIDv4 node identities
- after updating the live Core validator, the real Core API accepted UUIDv4 `node_id` values and completed `start -> approve -> finalize`
- approved registration record and trust activation payload both preserved `node_id = 123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000`

## Task 367-371
Original task source: user request on 2026-03-20

Preserved scope:
- Move provider budget configuration out of the generic setup surface and into provider-specific setup pages/routes using the shape `/setup/provider/<provider-name>`.
- Support schedule selection for provider budgets instead of amount-only configuration.
- The supported local provider budget schedule options requested are:
  - `monthly`
  - `weekly`
- Weekly budget periods must be defined as local-time calendar weeks running `Monday` through `Sunday`.
- Persistence and API contract updates must carry both the provider budget amount and its schedule type.
- Update the UI and docs so the provider setup flow makes the per-provider budget location and weekly/monthly behavior clear.

Task mapping:
- Task 367: Move provider budget setup into provider-specific setup routes
- Task 368: Add monthly/weekly provider budget scheduling model
- Task 369: Define weekly budget periods as local-time `Monday` through `Sunday`
- Task 370: Persist amount plus schedule type through config and API contracts
- Task 371: Update setup UI and documentation for provider budget scheduling

## Task 372-374
Original task source: user request on 2026-03-20

Preserved scope:
- Align the AI Node task-family vocabulary with the Core canonical naming for classification work.
- The explicit requested mapping is:
  - `task.classification.text` -> `task.classification`
- Update all relevant local surfaces so the canonical family is used consistently in:
  - task validation
  - execution
  - provider routing
  - prompt registration / authorization
  - setup and capability selection flows
  - API payloads
  - docs and tests
- If local persisted state or compatibility surfaces still contain the old value, add a migration or compatibility path so existing nodes do not break during the rename.

Task mapping:
- Task 372: Align local task-family vocabulary with Core canonical classification naming
- Task 373: Update execution, routing, prompt, and setup flows to emit/use `task.classification`
- Task 374: Add migration/compatibility handling for old `task.classification.text` state and remove doc/test drift

## Task 375-378
Original task source: user request on 2026-03-20

Preserved scope:
- Prompts are explicitly node-owned and must not be governed by Core.
- Remove or correct any local documentation, contracts, code assumptions, or queue items that imply Core approves, owns, distributes, or governs prompts for the AI Node.
- Core’s role for this area is limited to budget/spend authority declarations.
- The requested Core declaration model is:
  - “this node may spend up to X for these services/providers/models”
- Budget handling should therefore be expressed in terms of spend authority scoped by:
  - service
  - provider
  - model
- This work must not reintroduce Core-managed prompt governance through budget enforcement or API contracts.
- Diagnostics and docs should make the boundary obvious:
  - prompts are local to the node
  - spend authority comes from Core

Task mapping:
- Task 375: Remove any remaining Core-governs-prompts assumptions
- Task 376: Define the corrected local/Core budget contract around Core-issued spend authority
- Task 377: Implement service/provider/model scoped spend-allowance handling without Core prompt governance
- Task 378: Update diagnostics, API contracts, and docs for the corrected boundary

## Task 379-381
Original task source: user request on 2026-03-20

Preserved scope:
- Check whether the node currently tracks changes in available task families after selecting or deselecting provider models.
- If the enabled-model change alters the resolved task families exposed by the node, the node should automatically re-declare capabilities with Core.
- If the enabled-model change does not alter the resolved task families, avoid unnecessary redeclaration.
- Update the enabled-model API response, tests, and docs so operators can tell whether redeclaration was triggered or skipped.

Task mapping:
- Task 379: Detect resolved task-family changes after enabled-model updates
- Task 380: Trigger capability redeclaration only when enabled-model changes alter the task surface
- Task 381: Update API/tests/docs to report redeclaration outcome for enabled-model changes

## Task 382-386
Original task source: user request on 2026-05-19

Preserved scope:
- Build local LLM shadow benchmarking for OpenAI calls.
- Production execution must continue to use and return the OpenAI response.
- Every successful OpenAI call should be stored as a benchmark source record with enough normalized request/response data to replay locally.
- Each record should track local benchmark status independently for:
  - `qwen3-8b-q4_k_m`
  - `qwen3-14b-q4_k_m`
- The benchmark worker should run prompts against whichever llama.cpp model is currently loaded.
- Every 15 minutes, the worker should switch llama.cpp to the other benchmark model when there is pending work for that model.
- After switching, the worker should wait for readiness, then process all missing and new benchmark prompts for the currently loaded model.
- Local benchmark failures must be recorded without affecting the OpenAI production result.
- Persist comparison fields useful for the UI:
  - timestamp
  - prompt id/version
  - normalized input snippet or redacted request payload
  - OpenAI model/output/label/confidence/tokens/latency/cost
  - 8B output/label/confidence/tokens/latency/status/error
  - 14B output/label/confidence/tokens/latency/status/error
  - agreement/mismatch status
- Add a UI table for comparing OpenAI vs local model behavior.
- Keep retention bounded, for example by count or age, so replay data does not grow indefinitely.
- Avoid switching the local model while the local LLM is serving real production work; if that state cannot be detected yet, document and implement a conservative guard.

Task mapping:
- Task 382: Persist OpenAI shadow benchmark records for local LLM comparison
- Task 383: Add local LLM benchmark worker with per-model pending status
- Task 384: Add scheduled llama.cpp model switching for queued benchmark replay
- Task 385: Expose local LLM benchmark comparison API
- Task 386: Add local LLM benchmark comparison table to the node UI
